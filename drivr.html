          <h1 class="text-center">DriVR</h1>
          <p class="text-center"><i>Team: Angelina Lyubimova, Zachary Azrael, Braeden Callis, Conrad Hong, Ganesh Chandrasekaran <br /> Fall 2016</i></p>
            <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Of all the causes of death in the United States, accidents are the fourth on the list with over 130,000 deaths annually. Through survey findings, UniQUEST concluded that parents often feel unsafe when their children first start out operating a motor vehicle on their very own and would feel more comfortable if their child had to go through additional training to better prepare. </p>
                <p>Drivers today are expected to gain much of their understanding through their experiences in driver’s education. However, these experiences do not always resonate with the students that take these courses. Dull lectures and videos dated as far back as from 1995 add up to a very non-engaging and unmemorable time. If driver’s education is viewed in this way by the students, then they will not retain the important information that is being taught during class. This means that they will not receive the quality of education that is necessary to make them good drivers, and bad drivers mean unsafe roads. </p>
                <p>The driver’s education process is clearly dated. Modernization of the industry is necessary if the information taught is to be fully absorbed by new students who are getting increasingly more familiar with arriving technology. The problem becomes the fact that students do not remember enough from driver’s education, and the ideal solution is one that presents a way to increase student understanding in a modern, engaging way.</p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>UníQUEST designed a student survey to see what those who had recently taken driving classes thought about the course. The team was able to distribute the survey by reaching out to students from multiple universities within the United States, many of whom were likely to have gotten their licenses recently. Team UníQUEST received 642 responses within two weeks of distributing the survey. 496 of these respondents had taken a driver’s education course.</p>
                <p>The team wanted to find out whether respondents agreed with its initial assumption: that the experience was generally considered to be boring and unmemorable. What the survey results showed was that students did not mind the engagement aspect; when asked how engaging their experience was on a scale of 1-10, the median was a fairly neutral response of 5.5. UníQUEST concluded that the initial assumption that the experience was boring was not one that many others shared, and so decided that it would not be addressed in the solution. The survey results did show, however, that respondents had a difficult time remembering what they learned from their driver’s education experience. When asked a question about the proper course of action in a driving scenario in which a car begins to skid, 50% of the respondents who said that they remembered their experience “fairly well” answered incorrectly.</p>

            <h3>Product</h3>
                <p>The core component of DriVR is the simulation aspect, and there are several under each lesson plan to allow the mastery of every concept covered in class. This would start out with the Google Cardboard for feasibility. </p>
                <p>DriVR also increases the appeal of the driver’s education establishments in which it is implemented. Driver’s education schools differentiate themselves through the quality of their education. Parents naturally want to make sure that their children are as safe as possible on the road, so they will choose an institution that offers the best education in their eyes. DriVR increases information retention from driver’s education classes, making the student a better driver for the future. The schools can advertise this in a way that catches parents’ attention, drawing prospective parents and students to their establishment. This increased attention will create a greater influx of customers, increasing overall business for the institution.</p>

                
            <h3>Impact</h3>
                <p>The main impact of DriVR presents itself in two parts. The first is in its impact on new drivers, and the second is in its impact on driver’s education institutions. For new drivers, the virtual reality simulations increase subject retention from driver’s education, giving the student a greater, and more solidified, driving knowledge base. With this enhanced level of understanding, the new driver can approach a wide range driving situations with more confidence. Parents of these new drivers also gain more confidence in their children, putting their minds at ease. This all-around increase in driver confidence and knowledge means that people on the road are more prepared to deal with complex, dangerous situations, and greater preparedness leads to making more correct driving decisions. The right decisions at the right times lead to safer roads for all who use them. The potential user base is 4.3 million students, per year, according to data from Census Bureau.</p>
                <p>DriVR is an innovative and effective solution to the important problem of driver safety. It offers the user a chance to experience dangerous road situations without risk of injury, and allows them to qualify their mistakes and triumphs. The immersive quality of the simulations makes these errors and successes feel true to life and memorable. Users then learn from these and can apply this new knowledge to the next driving situation that they encounter. Over time, users develop a vastly increased information base that they can employ when compared to students who enrolled in a traditional driver’s education program. This strengthened knowledge base makes the new driver more confident, and makes the parents of this new driver more confident in their child as well.</p>
