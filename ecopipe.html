          <p class="text-center"><i>Team: Angelina Lyubimova, Zachary Azrael, Braeden Callis, Conrad Hong, Ganesh Chandrasekaran <br /> Fall 2016</i></p>
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>One of the biggest issues facing society today is generating clean energy. Increasing amounts of power are required to keep up with continuous population growth, yet harnessing this energy damages the environment. Hydroelectric power is highly efficient, ubiquitous, and relatively environmentally conscious. Team UníQUEST has designed a product that takes advantage of already existing, yet unharnessed, energy from flowing water in building pipe systems.</p>
            <h3>What is it?</h3>
                <p>The EcoPipe is a pipe section that utilizes the movement of water to spin a turbine with embedded magnets, which generates electricity and has potential to save the average large business 8.5% of its daily energy output.</p>
            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                <p>As a hydroelectric generator, the EcoPipe is designed to convert the kinetic energy found in moving water into usable electric power. High pressure from the pipe rotates a circumferentially mounted rotor within this pipe. Magnets are imbedded within the rotor and, as water flows through, both the rotor and the magnets spin. The rotating magnets create a changing magnetic field, and when placed near a magnetic material, generate electricity. The EcoPipe’s design includes a coil of wire fixed outside of the pipe. The current captured within the coil is then sent through a transformer to be converted into a useable voltage and frequency. This power is then routed directly into the building’s switchgear, which will distribute the electricity to other areas. For the current to be directed into the building’s electrical system, there are two options: the first is to store the current in a battery, where the energy can be used at a later time when necessary; and the second is to feed the current directly into the building, in which the energy will be used immediately.</p>
                <p>Pipe Size: 3-8 in <br /> Pipe Pressure: 20-100 psi  <br /> Water Flow Rate: 51 gallons/day/employee</p>
            <h3>Considerations</h3>
                <p>This process of decreasing water’s kinetic energy also decreases the water’s overall pressure. To ensure that it is not decreased to an undesirable level, the EcoPipe must be installed into main service lines strategically. Currently, main service lines include pressure reduction valves, units that decrease water pressure to a PSI that is in accordance with many public water systems. The EcoPipe’s rotors, as they deplete the kinetic energy of the moving water, effectively act as substitutes for pressure reduction valves. By doing so, there is little to no additional loss of pressure than what is already necessary.</p>
                <p>It is also highly reliable because it has only one moving part, the rotor, and zero mechanical connections. Our materials choices are actually selected to outlast the lifetime of the pipes themselves, and combined with the reliability factor, this means that our device will require a minimal amount of maintenance.</p>
